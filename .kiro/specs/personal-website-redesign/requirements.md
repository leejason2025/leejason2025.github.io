# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves redesigning an existing personal website template to create a more aesthetic and modern personal portfolio site. The redesign will focus on implementing a cohesive color scheme with a light tan background, updating the navigation structure to include three main sections (About, Art Projects, Coding Projects), and incorporating a personal logo. The website will maintain the existing project content while providing a fresh, clean visual presentation.
