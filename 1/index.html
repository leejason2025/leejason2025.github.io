                <p>
                    When I was first introduced to this project by Professor Alexei A. Efros, 
                    I was immediately captured by Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii’s innovative mindset. 
                    Prokudin-Gorskii was a pioneer in the field of color photography, 
                    foreseeing its future as early as 1907. After gaining special permission from the Tzar,
                    Prokudin-Gorskii embarked on an ambitious journey. In his expeditions across the Russian Empire,
                    he captured thousands of images, ranging from people to architecture to nature. 
                    His technique involved photographing scenes with three separate exposures on glass plates, 
                    each filtered through red, green, and blue filters. However, in Prokudin-Gorskii’s time period, 
                    there was no technology available to produce colored images from his black and white images. 
                    Prokudin-Gorskii’s glass plate negatives were later digitized by the Library of Congress, 
                    and thus the objective of this project became clear: to put Prokudin-Gorskii’s hard work 
                    into fruition and display a unique glimpse of the Russian Empire’s final years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The objective of my project is to take the digitized glass plate images and use 
                    image processing techniques to recreate color images with minimal visual artifacts. To 
                    achieve this, I implemented and tested several methods for aligning the three color channels.
                    Initially, I employed an exhaustive search method using L2 norm and normalized cross correlation 
                    on low resolution images. Based on the visual results, I determined that NCC offered better 
                    performance for alignment. I then implemented a Gaussian image pyramid approach to handle higher 
                    resolution images more efficiently. While this method successfully improved the alignment, it 
                    significantly increased computation time. To address this, I optimized my algorithm by vectorizing 
                    large array operations and parallelizing processes, which substantially reduced the processing time.

        <h2>Score Metric</h2>
        <p>
            In order to measure the quality of alignment between two images, I utilized <b>Normalized Cross 
            Correlation (NCC)</b> as the score metric. I picked NCC as it is a robust method for comparing the 
            similarity between two images by measuring the correlation between pixel intensities, normalized 
            to account for differences in lighting or contrast. This method computes the similarity on a scale 
            from -1 to 1, where a score closer to 1 indicates better alignment.

        <h2>Single Scale Search Approach</h2>
        <p>
            The <b>exhaustive align</b> method is a single scale search that aligns two images by testing all possible 
            shifts within a specified range. For each shift, the target image is displaced, and the similarity 
            to the reference image is measured using the NCC score. Here are the results on lower resolution images, with displacement range of [-16, 16].

    <section id="multi-scale-pyramid-search">
        <h2>Multi-Scale Pyramid Search</h2>
        <p>
            Furthermore, I implemented a <b>pyramid align</b> function that is a multi-scale approach which leverages 
            image pyramids to align two images more efficiently. This method progressively aligns images at 
            different resolutions, starting from a low resolution version and refining the alignment at higher 
            resolutions. First, I construct <b>Gaussian pyramids</b> for both the reference (base) and target (shift) 
            images by iteratively applying a Gaussian filter and downscaling the images at each level. Starting 
            with the lowest resolution images, I use the previously defined exhaustive align method to compute the optimal shift. 
            The alignment is then refined at each subsequent level by adjusting the displacement according to 
            the image's resolution. By progressively aligning the images from coarse to fine detail, this 
            approach reduces the search space at higher resolutions, resulting in faster and more efficient 
            alignment for large or high resolution images. Here are three results for high resolution images, ran with displacement range of [-64, 64].

    <section id="challenges-faced">
        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <p>
            <b>1. Inaccuracy in Exhaustive Search:</b> Initially, the exhaustive search method struggled with alignment accuracy, 
            even on low-resolution images. The issue was caused by the presence of borders in the images, which disrupted 
            the similarity calculations. I resolved this by manually cropping the images to remove the borders, which greatly 
            improved the alignment results.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>2. High Runtime:</b> When I first ran the naive version of the pyramid align function, the runtime exceeded 10 minutes
            per image. To address this, I optimized the performance in two key ways: first, I vectorized the large array 
            calculations to take advantage of faster, element-wise operations. Then, I implemented multi-core parallelism 
            using Joblib, which distributed alignment tasks across multiple CPU cores. Additionally, I used Numba to compile 
            Python functions into machine code, speeding up the individual computations. These optimizations reduced the 
            runtime to approximately 1 minute per image.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>3. Accuracy Issues:</b> After optimizing the runtime, the image alignment was still not as accurate as expected. The 
            issue stemmed from the lack of a Gaussian blur in the image pyramid. Once I applied the Gaussian blur to the images 
            during the pyramid construction, the alignment improved significantly.
