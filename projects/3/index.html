        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I explored face morphing techniques by producing a morph animation between two faces. 
            I also computed the mean of a population of faces and extrapolated a caricature from the mean. Face morphing 
            is achieved by warping the image shape and cross-dissolving the colors between two faces. The warp is controlled 
            by defining correspondences between facial features, such as the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears. Moreover, I worked with 
            images of Danish people and found the average face of a Danish person, as well as trasnformed myself into the opposite gender
             by using an averaged image of Chinese females.

        <h2>Defining Correspondences</h2>
        <p>
            I started by taking a picture of myself and selecting an image of Arthur Fleck (Joker). 
            To properly morph the images, I used a student-made keypoint labeling tool to mark corresponding
            facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth, etc.) on both images. These points ensured proper 
            alignment of facial features during the transformation. Next, I computed the mid-way shape 
            by averaging the correspondence points from both faces. Using these points, I applied 
            Delaunay triangulation to divide the faces into triangular regions, which helped 
            preserve the structure and smoothness during the morph. Finally, I visualized the 
            triangulation for my face, Joker's face, and the mid-way shape to confirm the 
            accuracy of the correspondences and triangulation.

        <h2>Computing the "Mid-way Face"</h2>
        <p>
            In this section, I computed the "mid-way face," which is a blend of both my face and the
            Joker's face. The mid-way face is created by averaging the shapes and pixel values of the 
            two images, resulting in a face that is a 50/50 mix of both. To achieve this, I used 
            Delaunay triangulation to divide both faces into corresponding triangles. For each 
            pair of triangles, I calculated an affine transformation that mapped my triangle onto 
            the mid-way triangle and similarly mapped the Joker's triangle to the same mid-way 
            triangle. Once the affine transformations were computed, I warped each triangle from 
            my face and from the Joker's face to fit the mid-way shape. Then I averaged the pixel 
            values of the warped regions from both images. Here is the result.

        <h2>The Morph Sequence</h2>
        <p>
            I created an animation that smoothly transitions my face into the Joker's face over 45 frames. 
            For each frame, I gradually warped the facial structure using intermediate points between both 
            faces, controlled by a warp fraction. Simultaneously, I blended the colors from both images 
            using a dissolve fraction, ensuring a smooth transition in appearance. The result was a 
            continuous morph sequence, where the shape and colors of my face gradually transformed into 
            the Joker's, producing a fluid and natural-looking animation.

        <h2>The "Mean Face" of a Population</h2>
        <p>
            Next, I worked with a dataset of 37 Danish faces to compute the average face. I began by extracting 
            key facial points from .asf files associated with each image, which marked important features. Using these keypoints, 
            I calculated the average shape of the faces and warped each face to fit this geometry using Delaunay triangulation. 
            After aligning all the faces to the average shape, I averaged their pixel values to create the "mean face" 
            of the population, representing the typical facial features of the dataset. Lastly, I compared my face to the 
            average face by warping my face into the average geometry and vice versa.

        <h2>Caricatures: Extrapolating from the Mean</h2>
        <p>
            For this section, I exaggerated my facial features by manipulating the keypoints in relation to 
            the average face of the population. Using an extrapolation factor (alpha), I adjusted the 
            keypoints to either emphasize the differences (positive alpha, e.g., 1.4) or make
            my features closer to the average (negative alpha, e.g., -1.5). I then warped my face to these
            new, exaggerated geometries using Delaunay triangulation, creating two caricatures: one where 
            my features are exaggerated and distinct, and another where they are more blended with the average.

        <h2>Changing Genders</h2>
        <p>
            In the Changing Genders section, I transformed my face into the face of an average Chinese female 
            by experimenting with both shape and appearance changes. First, I morphed my face into the female 
            shape by aligning my facial structure with the average female keypoints while keeping my original 
            appearance. Then, I applied only the female appearance, maintaining my original facial structure 
            but adopting the female's textures and colors. Finally, I combined both the shape and appearance t
            ransformations, fully morphing my face into a female version, altering both the geometry and visual 
            traits.
